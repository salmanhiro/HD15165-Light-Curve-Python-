# HD15165-Light-Curve-Python-

Plotting the light curve from differential photometry of HD15165 using Python. This is my Basic Astronomy Laboratory II Final Report on Observation. 

The .csv file was processed using related .lst file produced from data processed with Iris previously, and used providing magnitude of stars. 

To run the simulation,


`git clone https://github.com/salmanhiro/HD15165-Light-Curve-Python-.git`


`python lc.py`

This code could be use for plotting variable stars light curve, just change the `hasil.csv` file from your own processing, and change the plot label for convenience.

Data was taken from Bosscha Observatory with STEVia telescope. Report of the observation could be looked at `report(Indonesian).pdf` (only available at Indonesian version for now)
